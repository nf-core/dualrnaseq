## Introduction

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write a 1-2 sentence summary of what data the pipeline is for and what it does -->
**nf-core/dualrnaseq** is a bioinformatics best-practise analysis pipeline for

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Quick Start

1. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation) (`>=20.04.0`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```bash
    nextflow run nf-core/dualrnaseq -profile test,<docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
    ```

    > Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.

4. Start running your own analysis!

    <!-- TODO nf-core: Update the example "typical command" below used to run the pipeline -->

    ```bash
    nextflow run nf-core/dualrnaseq -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute> --input '*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz' --genome GRCh37
    ```

See [usage docs](https://nf-co.re/dualrnaseq/usage) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.

## Pipeline Summary

By default, the pipeline currently performs the following:

<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of default steps of pipeline -->

* Sequencing quality control (`FastQC`)
* Overall pipeline run summaries (`MultiQC`)

## Documentation

The nf-core/dualrnaseq pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline: [usage](https://nf-co.re/dualrnaseq/usage) and [output](https://nf-co.re/dualrnaseq/output).

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add a brief overview of what the pipeline does and how it works -->
