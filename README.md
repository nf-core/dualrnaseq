## Dual RNA-seq pipeline

**nf-core/dualrnaseq** is a bioinformatic pipeline built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

### Introduction

**nf-core/dualrnaseq** is specifically used for the analysis of Dual RNA-seq data, interrogating host-pathogen interactions through simultaneous RNA-seq.

This pipeline has been initially tested with eukaryotic host's including Human and Mouse, and pathogens including *Salmonella enterica*, *Orientia tsutsugamushi*, *Streptococcus penumoniae*, *Escherichia coli* and *Mycobacterium leprae*. The workflow should work with any eukaryotic and bacterial organisms with an available reference genome and annotation.

### Method

The workflow merges host and pathogen genome annotations taking into account differences in annotation conventions, then processes raw data from FastQ inputs ([FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), [BBDuk](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/)),   quantifies gene expression ([STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) and [HTSeq](https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/master/); [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR), [Salmon](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/) and [tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html); or [Salmon](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/) in quasimapping mode and [tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html)), and summarises the results ([MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/)), as well as generating a number of custom summary plots and separate results tables for the pathogen and host. See the [output documentation](docs/output.md) for more details.
